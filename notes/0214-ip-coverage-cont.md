Continued from last week, I drew two additional plots to better describe the beginning of the (IP coverage ratio) to (probed channel %) plot.

### 1. IP Coverage Ratio v.s. Log Top Channel Count

### 2. IP Coverage Ratio v.s. Top 200 Channel Count

Since the log plot in section 1. may not be intuitive to comprehend, I also drew a closer look of the top 200 channels' contribution to IP coverage ratio.
